# Anayzing the Musical Characteristics of Viral TikTok Songs
This repository contains the data collection, processing, and anlaysis code I used in writing the mock (unsubumitted) paper [Analyzing the Musical Characteristics of Viral TikTok Songs](https://github.com/jmsech/viral-tiktok-music-analysis/blob/master/Analyzing%20the%20Musical%20Characteristics%20of%20Viral%20TikTok%20Songs.pdf). Please view the PDF to read the final presentation of my methods and findings.

## Overview
### Motivation
Technology has always been a major influence in how we experience music-—both in how we listen and how it is created. The invention of the radio brought the sub 3 minute "pop” song format. Long-playing vinyl allowed artists to craft the full length “album” that we know today. Mixtapes came from the accessibility of cassette tapes and CDs, and now instant, on-demand Internet streaming brings an unlimited new wealth of variety to how we consume and create music.
The recent surge in the short-form video social media site, TikTok [9], has made an undeniable impact on the current state of the music industry. In December 2018, the never before heard artists, Lil Nas X, released his song “Old Town Road”. Thanks to TikTok’s ease of virality, “Old Town Road” quickly amassed millions of plays, reached the top of the Billboard charts, and Lil Nas X was subsequently nominated for 6 Grammy Awards, winning 2 [3]. Lil Nas X and “Old Town Road” may be the most prominent example, but a song making its viral debut on TikTok is not an isolated incident.

### Research Goals
This paper investigates the dynamic between TikTok and the rest of our modern day music industry. Specifically, this work aims to answer the following research questions:
1. Do songs trend on TikTok before they reach the Spotify or Billboard charts
2. Is there a measurable distinction in songs that first trend on TikTok compared to songs trending equally across all platforms or that reach TikTok later <br>

This work explores Question 1 by analyzing Trending Sound data scraped from TikTok against archival music charts from various Spotify and Billboard chart categories. Question 2 is subsequently evaluated using meta data and audio analysis data obtained from the Spotify API.
